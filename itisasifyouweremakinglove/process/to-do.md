- ~~Create basic annyang voice commands (2018-04-12 13:54, Thursday)~~
- ~~Create basic "slide between x and y" instructions randomly generated (2018-04-12 13:35, Thursday)~~
- ~~Create acknowledgment of correct sliding (2018-04-12 13:35, Thursday)~~
- ~~Create basic connection between synthesis (e.g. tone) and sliding (2018-04-12 13:35, Thursday)~~
- ~~Make the version with the slider in its own little window (test in mobile)~~
- ~~Add a text panel to indicate instruction modifiers and other phrases~~
- ~~Add a progress bar (need to think about how this is going to look)~~
- ~~__NAH__ Add numbers to the pips? (I feel like this is not very win95-y, but otherwise how do you know what the setting it?)~~
- ~~__IT'S BETTER IN THE PANEL I THINK__Highlight the setting to slider to on the slider (try this over the version where it's in the panel)~~
- ~~Add some kind of timing requirement to stay on a selection before moving on to avoid mindless stroking~~
- ~~Add a popup dialog with a text to type in and test on mobile (make it modal)~~
- ~~Write a journal entry about sounds to figure out how they'll work~~
- ~~Add sounds from Win 2000~~
- ~~__INDEED YOU NEED AN EVENT TO TRIGGER IT__Check iOS audio triggering issues on actual device~~
- ~~Add an application icon to load the game (gives us the music trigger too for iOS)~~
- ~~Add radio/checkbox/button for toggling 'mood music' on and off~~
- ~~Add array for strokes-per-range to emphasise higher stroke counts~~
- ~~Add array for stroke ranges to emphasise specific ranges~~
- ~~Add stroke timing (just frames between correct settings makes enough sense)~~
- ~~Shift arousal tracking to per-stroke, make sure notify is per range-change~~
- ~~Make a proper title card for when it's 'loading'~~
- ~~Add speed requirement (just slow, normal, fast perhaps - or even instead of normal just 'indifferent') and checking (maybe you have some number of 'bad' strokes before it notifies you, reset at each preference change)~~
- ~~Pretty sure it's possible to have a new range start with the selection you're already on? Bad. Easy fix too.~~
- ~~Add breathing sound fading in to progress (first approximation can just be a straight progress=volume)~~
- ~~__HAVING PLAYED MORE I THINK I DISAGREE WITH THIS NOW__ Think about speed in relation to range size (slow on a short range kind of sucks)~~
- ~~Add ability to notify player of desired pace and range (e.g. in instruction try 'Set me between 0 and 10 in fast alternation')~~
- ~~Add array of text-input requests and correct answers~~
- ~~Add array of no-input dialog texts that are rewards for good play? (Bit weird if they interrupt, maybe not?)~~
- ~~Add ability to notify player of failure to match pace (e.g. in output), which builds to dialog notification~~
- ~~Add ability to notify player of good performance (maybe based on error rate) in output and in dialog~~
- ~~Consider a cooldown after all? Just a simple arousal going down over time, not as a punishment, but as an expressive possibility for the player?~~
- ~~The basic orgasm~~
  - ~~Add ending as dialog box (tada, thanks), closing the dialog plays shutdown sound and goes back to desktop~~
  - ~~Add sound constellation to ending~~
  - ~~Add slider value twitching to ending~~
  - ~~Add diminishing of ending~~
- ~~__NO__ Add idea of application needing a cool-down (an hour or so?)?~~
- ~~__NAH__ Add idea of setting a next date?~~
- ~~Add a readme.txt to the desktop that contains diegetic information about the experience~~
- ~~Speed up the slow? Slow down the fast? (Different values for mobile?)~~
- ~~__NAH FUCK OFF__ Pips on both sides for mobile? "Handedness" as a UI element to position them? (ha ha, but probably really not enough room in the UI)~~
- ~~Work on the language a lot~~
- ~~__YOU KNOW WHAT? NO. IT'S PLAYABLE AS IS I BELIEVE? THOUGH SHOULD DOUBLE-CHECK ON ACTUAL DEVICE SHIT__ Try to deal with the screen size of the iPhone 5/SE (sigh)~~
- ~~Check how well it renders on my phone~~
- ~~Consider issue of height of About (even on my iPhone when the full browser UI is visible you can't see the full about, though you can see the full app) - smaller text? less text?~~
- ~~__NOPE__ Can you bear trying to restyle jQuery version of radio buttons to have them look more 'authentic'? (Almost certainly not.)~~
- ~~Check actual visibility of UI on iPhone SE (it it too long vertically? How fucked am I on the SE?)~~
- ~~Think about sound issues on iOS - test when and how you can trigger sounds in slide event (guess it's maybe a version of mouse-moved?)~~
- ~~__DID IT__ Consider removing positive feedback and input dialogs as too distracting~~
- ~~__THE ABOVE SHOULD ELIMINATE THIS ERROR__ Fix glitch where you can end up with a feedback dialog still visible during the end game, confusing things and creating dual modals (this would be eliminated by the above decision if made)~~
- ~~__SURE__ Make a trailer~~
- ~~__NO NEED, IT'S RAINING NOW.__ Pray for rain~~
- ~~Take screenshots~~
- ~~Write the press kit~~
