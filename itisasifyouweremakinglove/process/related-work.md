## Games

#### Unknown. [Sepe's Cumshot](https://www.comdotgame.com/play/sepes-cumshot)

Extremely not safe for work porn site. The key inspiration. Incredibly simple Flash game where you masturbate a muscular dude by waving the cursor over his penis. Fascinating for actually managing to create a kind of erotic situation despite being pretty crass.

#### Robert Yang. [Stick Shift](https://radiatoryang.itch.io/stick-shift)

A bit like Sepe's Cumshot if Sepe were a car? A more metaphorical masturbatory experience, or at least indirect. Incredible production values.

#### [Kayabros](http://www.kayabros.com/). [Sleepy Time](https://kayabros.itch.io/sleepy-time).

A masturbation rhythm game. The rhythmic emphasis really helps it to feel erotic, different stroke lengths/timings makes a difference to how organic it feels.

## Software

### [TeaseAI](http://teaseai.wikidot.com/main:gettinstarted)

An incredibly comprehensive and configurable piece of software to simulate being teased by a domme via an online chat app, used by a community of people who also create distinct personalities for the app.

#### Joel Couture. [The Heartbeat Symposium - Exploring Love, Sex, & Intimacy In Games](http://indiegames.com/2018/04/the_heartbeat_symposium_-_expl.html). Gamasutra, 17 April 2018.

An article about a group promoting the creation of games about love and intimacy and who run an event about this. Useful writing about this as a subject for games, has examples too.
